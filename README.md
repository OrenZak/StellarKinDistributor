# KIN Distributor
This project lets you send KIN to a given wallet address over Stellar TestNet.
It will create a KIN asset, related to the issuer seed in `config.json` file.
Use the `send()` function which accepts a URL address as a parameter. This will issue 1000 KIN to the specified address.
You can create issuer seed on [Stellar Laboratory](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/#account-creator?network=test).
