## KIN Distributor
This project lets you run a small localhost server that communicates with stellar network.
It will create a KIN asset on Stellar Test Network, related to the issuer seed in `config.json` file.
You will have a rest-api `sendkin` where you need to pass address as url parameter<br/>
and the issuer will send 1K KIN to the specific address.
You can create issuer seed on [Stellar Laboratory](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/#account-creator?network=test).
